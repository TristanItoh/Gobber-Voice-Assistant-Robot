# Gobber: Voice Assistant Robot 🤖
A voice assistant robot that listens to requests and responds, powered by Gemini and OpenAI Whisper, all with custom animations to give it a personality.

## Why?
I've been wanting to make this project for a while but never fully commited to it. Now I finally have the opportunity to. The project is inspired by voice assistants on mobile devices, like Siri, but with a physical body and animated face.

## Technical Overview:
This robot uses a combination of hardware, software, and firmware:
- 🔧 **Hardware**: Controlled by an ESP32-S3 that will be plugged into the computer, recieves input from the microphone, and outputs audio through the audio amp and speaker.
- 🪲 **Firmware**: Basic code for the ESP32 as sort of a gate between the hardware and the Python software on the computer. Audio in, audio out.
- 💻 **Software**: Recieves mp3 files of input audio, translates it to text using OpenAI whisper, passes it into Gemini with context, then finally generates text-to-speech using ElevenLabs with a goofy voice.
- 🔩 **CAD**: Very smooth, curvy, triangular shape. Round display centered on the front, with holes for USB-c, microphone, and speaker.
